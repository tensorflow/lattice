TensorFlow Lattice is a library that implements fast-to-evaluate and
interpretable (optionally monotonic) lattice based models, which are also known
as *interpolated look-up tables*. The library includes a collection of
Estimators, which operate like any TensorFlow Estimator. It also includes
Keras layers for lattices and feature calibration that can be composed
into custom models.
